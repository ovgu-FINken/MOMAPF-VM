# Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Path Finding with Vehicle Models -- MOMPAF-VM

## Reference

This Repository contains the research conducted for the paper Sebastian Mai, Sanaz Mostaghim "Planning Agents in Swarm Intelligence" accepted at the ANTS 2020.

## Files

The main file is the jupyter notebook. It includes instructions on how the project is working and gives an overview on the code base.
Otherwise the project is setup to run experiments and store the results based in a SQL database, for development I suggest to use sqlite as a DB.

## Installation

* Before using I reccomend to create a virtual environment for pythen (e.g. with the python venv)
* TODO: Compile package list outside of jupyter notebook
* The main notebook contains a list of packages to install in the first cell
* If you want to contribute please install the pre-commit hook, so videos are not added to the git repo
