# Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Path Finding with Vehicle Models -- MOMPAF-VM

## Files

The main file is the jupyter notebook. It includes instructions on how the project is working and gives an overview on the code base.
Otherwise the project is setup to run experiments and store the results based in a SQL database, for development I suggest to use sqlite as a DB.
